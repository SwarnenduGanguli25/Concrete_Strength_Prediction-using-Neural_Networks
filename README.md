# Concrete_Strength_Prediction-using-Neural_Networks
### *It consists of 4 parts*:
<!-- -->
**PART-A**: Neural Network with 1 hidden layer of 10 nodes, ReLU activation function and Adam optimizer
        Model training with 50 Epochs and calculating the mean and standard deviation of all 50 mean squared errors
<br>
**PART-B**: Model training with normalized data of the above part and comparing the mean with that of part-A
<br>
**PART-C**: Model training with normalized data but with 100 Epochs and comparing the mean with that of part-B
<br>
**PART-D**: Neural Network with 3 hidden layers each of 10 nodes and ReLU activation function
        Model training with normalized data with 50 Epochs and comparing the mean with that of part-B
